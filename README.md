NOTE: I have done this project and added it on bitbucket, but have decided to upload everything on Github. Please find the link to the bitbucket repo to check the date of upload -  https://Tanmayk24@bitbucket.org/Tanmayk24/lca_pyhton.git




This is an implementation of Lowest Common Ancistors in Binary Tree in Python by Tanmay Kaushik.
You can find the Java implementation of the same project in a different repo. by the name of LCA_Java
Cheers! :)

NOTES made by developer:

1. Used a binary tree module to create a binary tree in the program. 
2. Added the unit test file on 18 Oct 2020.
3. I have changed the main file name from lea-python to lcaPython (in the test file) because of formating issues.
